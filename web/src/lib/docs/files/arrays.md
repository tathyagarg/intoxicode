# Arrays
As shown in the previous section, arrays are a collection of elements. Unlike in most languages, arrays in Intoxicode can store multiple data types. This does kind of defeats the purpose of arrays, but it is useful in some cases. For example, you can store a string and an integer in the same array. (Yes, I know, this is really a list but we call it an array for some reason.)

## Creating an Array
```intox
array = [1, "Hello", 3.14, true].
```

## Accessing Elements
To access elements in an array, you can use the index of the element. The index starts at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

```intox
array = [1, "Hello", 3.14, true].
scream(array[0]).
```

## Modifying Elements
Nuh uh.
