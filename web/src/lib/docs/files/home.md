# Intoxicode Documentation
Intoxicode is an esolang built for the [Twist YSWS](https://twist.hackclub.dev). The premise of the language is to run code like a drunken person would. The language is designed to be fun and chaotic, with a focus on creativity and humor.

## Differentiating Features
- **Randomness**: Intoxicode introduces a level of randomness to the execution of code, simulating the unpredictable nature of drunken behavior. Certain lines of code may get skipped or executed multiple times, adding an element of surprise to the program's output.

- **Certainty Modifiers**: The language includes modifiers that can be applied to lines of code to influence their execution. These modifiers can increase the likelihood of a line being executed or skipped, allowing for a more controlled level of randomness. However, use of certainty modifiers to guarantee execution using a period is limited to 4 lines or 1/4 of the total lines in the program, whichever is greater. (*PS: Support for variable certainty modifiers is planned for a future release.*)

## Why use Intoxicode?
