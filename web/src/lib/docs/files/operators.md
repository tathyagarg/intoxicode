# Operations
Like any other programming language, Intoxicode supports some basic operations. There operations are:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Comparison Operations**: Equal to (`==`), not equal to (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`)
- **Logical Operations**: Logical AND (`and`), logical OR (`or`).

**Note**: Intoxicode does not support `>=` or `<=` operators. Instead, you can use the `>` and `<` operators in combination with `==` and `and` to achieve the same effect.
